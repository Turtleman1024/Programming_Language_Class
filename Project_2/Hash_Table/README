	Purpose       : Learning Hash Tables in OCAML

	To run this source code: $make hash

	This directory holder the information and source code form me trying to learn hash tables in ocaml. I plan on using a hash table as the symbol table for project 2.	

	1. Hash tables are used for quick data storage and retrieval.
	2. Hash tables look like (key, value) pairs ......  (name, address)
	3. Data (records) are stored in buckets using hash keys.
	4. Hash keys are calculated by applying a hasing algorithm to a chosen value contained within the record.
	5. Collision???
		If the hashing function produces the same index(key) for two different key values.
		Instead of store just one value we can store two values (called chaining).
	6. Hash Tables in Ocaml are polymorphic
