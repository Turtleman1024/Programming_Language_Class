This directory holds some programs I wrote to learn OCaml.

Included in this directory is a Makefile that will run each of the source code I have created.

****HelloWorld.ml*****
I first created a simple Hello World program.
To run this source code simply type: $make hello

****Pattern_Matching.ml*****
This is my first program that I wrote for OCaml.
It is a simple program that uses pattern matching to find the month of the year.
To run this source code simply type: $make pattern

****Currying.ml*****
To understand how to use function in OCaml. I wrote a program that uses currying.
To run this source code simply type: $make currying


****Factorial.ml*****
To bring everything together what I had learned up to a point. I created a program that 
calculates a user inputed factorial number.
To run this source code simply type: $make factorial


****Fibonacci.ml*****
To further bring everything together what I had learned up to a point. I created
a program that calculates a user inputed fibonacci number.
To run this source code simply type: $make fibonacci


****Reading_from_file.ml*****
To understand how to read from a file I created a program from a definition of a 
turing machine.
To run this source code simply type: $make read_file
